# bigram-language-model
A test task for nFactorial Incubator Summer 2023 

Launch instructions:
1. To start the project, please, download the "bigram language model" folder.
2. Execute the "bigram-language-model.py" code in Terminal or Python IDLE.
3. For example, open the folder in Terminal and insert "python .\bigram-language-model.py".
3. The table of bigrams and their probabilities will be output in a separate .html file for better readibility of the Terminal outputs.
4. The result (a new baby name) of a trained neural network on small amount of epochs (n = 100) will be printed in the Terminal.
5. The graph of the bigrams' sample space will be opened in another window.
